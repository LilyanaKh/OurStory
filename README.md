Important:

1. While working with PostgreSQL make sure you don't choose reserved name for variables such as 'User' or 'Like' - I have waisted a lot of time fixing problems because of this.
2. Try working on different files in the project, each one. And if you must work on same the file, make sure to work on different "blocks" of code in the file so conflicts won't appear.
3. Try coding organized, write comments.
4. If you finish your work, try help other teammates.
5. Ask me every question you want.

Have fun & happy coding,

		Yarden.
